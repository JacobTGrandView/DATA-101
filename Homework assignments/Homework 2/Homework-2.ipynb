    "### Exercise 1 - An online movie streaming company has a business problem of growing customer churn. That is, subscription customers are canceling their subscriptions to join the competitor. Create an analytics plan that could be used to address this business problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Analyze the cost difference of both subscriptions. Does the new subscription have a lower price but more available movies? Are there highly-rated & popular movies that aren't on your streaming service that are on theirs. Are they offering special deals when new customers sign up, such as 3 months of free spotify premium for example. Does one service have no good movie recommendations? If the issue is bad recommendations and not knowing anything to watch, then you could analyze the data to see the most popular movies on all streaming services, then build a model to suggest the highest rated and most popular movies to the recommended page if people are not enjoying what they see.

    "### Exercise 2 - Although their sales are reasonable, an online fashion retailer is struggling to generate the volume of sales that they had originally hoped for when launching their site. Create an analytics plan that could be used to address this business problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Analyze the store's website statistics and other websites with obtainable data to see people's browsing behavior, what part of the website they spend the most time on, what the best-selling category/thing is on your website and others and see if it can be pushed more. Analyze the average cost of each sale and sales of other stores, check the difference in prices between similar items. Are you able to slightly increase the price without seeing a drop in sales. You could build a model to suggest items based on people's history or predict the highest-selling item during different times during the year. Also, use a model to see if increasing prices would decrease sales based on other competition and demand for something."
